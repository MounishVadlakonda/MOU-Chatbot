Recommended Cardio
Adults should participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 60 minutes of vigorous-intensity per week. You can do this in one exercise session or break it down throughout the week. Shorter sessions should be at least 10 minutes.

Exercise Intensity
Exercise intensity varies for each individual. Determining the level of exercise intensity depends on how it is affecting your body. For moderate-intensity exercise, MayoClinic.com states that it should feel somewhat difficult. Breathing should quicken, a light sweat should develop after 10 minutes and you can still carry on a conversation. In contrast, vigorous-intensity exercise causes deep and rapid breathing, sweat after a few minutes and conversation becomes difficult.

Considerations
In addition to weight training and cardio exercise, the ACSM recommends stretching exercises to increase flexibility, improve range of motion and reduce injury. Adults should perform stretching exercise two to three days a week. Before starting any new exercise program, consult a physician. Monitor your heart rate on a regular basis to make sure you are staying within your target heart rate. According to MayoClinic.com, the maximum heart rate for you is roughly calculated by subtracting your age from 220. Your physician can also recommend a target heart rate specific for you.

How Many Calories Should a 120-Pound Woman Consume Daily?
By Erin Coleman, R.D., L.D.
Estimating your calorie needs doesn't have to be confusing.
Although many tedious formulas exist to help determine your daily calorie needs, it’s simple to estimate your calorie requirements using just your body weight and activity level. Most women who weigh 120 pounds are within a healthy weight range. According to California State University Northridge, 120 pounds is the ideal body weight for a woman who is 5 feet 4 inches tall; however, this estimate can vary by as much as 10 percent depending on frame size.

General Requirements
Using body weight to help determine calorie needs works for both men and women; although men require more calories than women, they tend to weigh more as well. According to a study published in a 2012 edition of “Food and Nutrition Research,” men and women need about 13 to 18 calories per pound of body weight each day; therefore, most 120-pound women require 1,560 to 2,160 calories per day to maintain a healthy body weight. Specific requirements are based on activity level.

Inactive Women
Inactive women who weigh 120 pounds need fewer calories than 120-pound women who exercise. According to the University of Washington, women with low activity levels require 13 calories per pound of body weight each day. This means a 120-pound inactive woman needs about 1,560 calories each day to maintain a healthy body weight.

Moderate Active Women
Moderately active women need 15 to 16 calories per pound of body weight each day; the University of Washington recommends15 calories per pound of body weight for moderately active women, while Harvard Medical School advises moderately active women to consume 16 calories per pound of body weight. This means a 120-pound moderately active woman may require 1,800 to 1,920 calories per day to maintain a healthy body weight.

Active Women And Athletes
The University of Washington and Harvard Medical School both recommend active women who engage in regular strenuous exercise consume about 18 calories per pound of body weight each day. Based on these guidelines, a 120-pound active woman needs about 2,160 calories per day to maintain a healthy body weight. Women endurance or strength-trained athletes may need even more calories. According to North Carolina State University, men and women athletes trying to build lean muscle may require 24 to 27 calories per pound of body weight; this means a 120-pound woman who wants to increase muscle mass needs 2,880 to 3,240 calories each day.

What Is the Maximum Time You Should Work Out?
By Natasha Hochlowski
Weightlifting for too long can cause muscle strain.
The maximum amount of time that you should work out each day depends on your own level of fitness and experience. If you're new to exercise, 30 minutes may be the most you can handle, but if you're experienced, you might be able to spend two hours at the gym. Experts agree that there is a maximum amount of time that you should work out per week -- depending on the type of exercise -- to avoid overtraining and muscle strain.

Rest
Without rest, your body cannot heal itself between workouts. If you continue to exercise the same muscles without giving them time to recover, you risk overtraining and injury. Overtraining -- training for so long that you have difficulty recovering -- can cause fatigue, depression, weight loss and minor injuries. Achieve rest by getting a good night's sleep and by taking a break between workouts. Take at least one day off every week to recover from exercise. On your resting days, stretch for longer than you would on your workout days, focusing on any muscles that feel sore. If you really feel an urge to stay active on your resting days, swim a few easy laps in the pool for a low-impact workout.

Aerobic Exercise
Performing aerobic exercise for too long can lead to heart problems, according to a 2008 study conducted for the "European Heart Journal." This study found that people who ran every day for many years had significantly more heart tissue scarring and artery plaque buildup than a representative group of nonathletes. Too much aerobic exercise can negatively affect your metabolism, leading to muscle loss. Avoid health problems by limiting aerobic exercise to a maximum of five days per week.

Anaerobic Exercise
Anaerobic exercise works your body at a high level of intensity, and as such, you should limit it. Weightlifting for too long, for example, can strain your muscles and cause injury. Aim for a maximum of two to three days of anaerobic exercise per week with one to two days of rest in between. Ensure that your anaerobic exercise works a variety of muscle groups by only working each group once or twice per week.

Considerations
Pay attention to your body and stop working out if you feel exhausted or in pain. If you always feel sore the day after working out, you have found your personal maximum -- try cutting down your workout by 10 minutes. No matter how long you are working out, start your workouts with several minutes of light aerobic activity. Start and end your workouts with several minutes of stretching to avoid injury.

DIETS FOR WEIGHT LOSS
How Much Weight Can You Lose Eating 1,350 Calories a Day?
By Erin Coleman, R.D., L.D.
Regardless of how much you weigh, you should lose weight eating 1,350 calories a day.
Women can lose a significant amount of weight and slim their waistlines by eating just 1,350 calories per day. However, the amount of weight you’ll lose depends on your body weight and activity level. According to a study published in a 2006 edition of the journal “Obesity,” diets containing 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day may be just as effective in the long term for weight loss as very-low-calorie diets containing fewer than 800 calories per day.

Weight-Loss Basics
A safe rate of weight loss is up to 2 pounds per week, which requires you to reduce your calories by 1,000 per day, states the Mayo Clinic. You should lose 2 pounds per week eating 1,350 calories a day if your previous calorie intake was 2,350 calories per day. But if your pre-diet calorie intake was more than 2,350 calories per day, 1,350 calories a day can lead to a more significant weight loss. If you feel hungry on a 1,350-calorie diet, slightly boost your calorie intake. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that safe and effective weight-loss diets usually range from 1,000 to 1,600 calories for women.

Sedentary Adults
Your individualized calorie needs for weight maintenance and weight loss are determined using your current body weight and activity level. Harvard Medical School reports that sedentary adults need about 13 calories per pound of body weight each day to maintain their weight. For example, a sedentary woman who weighs 150 pounds needs about 1,950 calories per day to maintain her weight, and about 1,000 calories per day to lose 2 pounds per week. If the same 150-pound woman eats 1,350 calories per day, she should lose slightly more than 1 pound per week.

Moderately Active Adults
Engaging in physical activity during your weight-loss program can help boost your energy, burn excess fat, increase muscle definition and reduce your risk for heart disease. Moderately active adults need about 16 calories per pound of body weight to maintain their weight, according to Harvard Medical School. Therefore, a 150-pound moderately active woman needs about 2,400 calories per day for weight maintenance and 1,400 calories a day to lose about 2 pounds per week.

Active Adults
Increasing your physical activity level to vigorous boosts your calorie needs for weight loss. Active adults engaging in strenuous exercise may need up to 18 calories per pound of body weight each day to maintain their weight, according to the University of Washington. A150-pound, active woman needs about 2,700 calories per day for weight maintenance and 1,700 calories each day to lose about 2 pounds per week; eating 1,350 calories per day will likely cause her to lose almost 2.5 pounds per week.

FAMILY PLANNING
Does Exercise Affect a Woman's Fertility?
By Jennifer Carr
Moderate exercise improves your health and your fertility.
Exercise is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Fertility is affected by exercise dependent on the amount performed. Vigorous exercise and lack of exercise can affect female fertility through hormonal imbalances as well as disruption in the menstrual cycle and ovulation. Moderate exercise has been found to be beneficial when trying to conceive.

Vigorous Exercise
Vigorous aerobic exercise can inhibit the production of progesterone and estrogen, the hormones necessary for ovulation and pregnancy. Ovulation cycles are disrupted by too much aerobic exercise as the body virtually shuts down the reproductive system to maintain other systems directly affected by exercise. An article edited by David Olive that appeared in the August 2010 issue of "Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology" indicates that the frequency, duration, and the intensity level of exercise reduces a women's infertility thus the chances of becoming pregnant. Female athletes, the article states, often experience adverse effects in regard to their fertility.

Lack Of Exercise
Simultaneously, lack of exercise can affect the fertility of women. Sedentary lifestyles are closely associated with excess weight gain which can cause the body to produce too much estrogen reducing fertility. At the same time, excess weight may result in an increase of insulin, which affects the entire hormone system. Too much insulin can cause women to produce high levels of testosterone which can cause egg production to stop. Women who wish to conceive should consult their doctor about appropriate exercise routines.

Moderate Exercise
Moderate exercise has been associated with improved fertility. Exercise helps to control weight, prevent certain health conditions, improve mood and energy levels and enhance sex. It is recommended that women of a healthy weight engage in aerobic exercise at most seven hours a week when trying to conceive. Underweight and overweight women should consult with their doctors for exercise recommendations.

Exercise, Fertility And Weight
Exercise resulting in weight loss and reduction of body mass index disrupts menstrual cycles. Women who lose a significant amount of weight may experience inadequate levels of hormones in the uterine lining, which can compromise conception. Underweight women, with a BMI of 18.5 or less, may experience irregular menstrual cycles, which can hinder ovulation. Normal weight women, with a BMI between 19 and 24, also reduce their fertility with excessive exercise.

HEALTHY EATING
Calorie Counts Based on Sizes of People
By Erin Coleman, R.D., L.D.
Choose small portions to avoid weight gain.
Although determining your calorie needs seems like a daunting task, you can estimate your body’s calorie requirements using just your body weight. If shedding pounds is your goal, use your ideal body weight to estimate your needs. Your activity level is also a good indicator of how many calories you should eat daily for healthy weight management.

Overweight Women
If your goal is to drop a few pounds, a reduced-calorie diet is in order. Washington State University suggests overweight and obese women eat 10 calories for each pound of their desirable body weight. Therefore, if your goal weight is 130 pounds, aim for 1,300 calories daily. If your desirable weight is 120 pounds, shoot for 1,200 calories a day to reach that goal. A good place to start is by eliminating sugary drinks, desserts, other sweets, high-fat meats, full-fat dairy foods and refined grains – such as white bread.

Sedentary Women
If you’re at a healthy weight but don’t work out, you need about 13 calories for each pound of your body weight to maintain your weight, according to Harvard Health Publications. For example, if you’re inactive and weigh 120 pounds, you’d need about 1,560 calories daily to maintain your weight. If you’re sedentary and weigh 130 pounds, aim for about 1,690 calories a day for healthy weight maintenance. Inactive 140-pound women need 1,820 calories daily to maintain their weight.

Active Women
Boosting your calorie expenditure means you can eat a little more – but still maintain a healthy weight. If you’re moderately active, aim for 15 calories per pound of your body weight daily. However, if you regularly exercise at a strenuous intensity, shoot for 18 calories per pound of your body weight daily to maintain your current weight. For example, a 130-pound woman who is moderately active needs about 1,950 calories daily, but 2,340 calories a day if she is active on a regular basis.

Female Athletes
Women athletes who train at high intensities on a regular basis may need extra calories to keep up with the demands of intense physical training. Female athletes require 20 to 23 calories per pound of their body weight daily, reports the University of Missouri Extension. Therefore, a 130-pound athlete often needs 2,600 to 2,990 calories daily to maintain her current body weight. You can also estimate your protein needs using your body weight. The International Society of Sports Nutrition suggests active adults need 0.64 to 0.91 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily, which is 83 to 118 grams of protein per day for 130-pound female athletes.

CARDIO
What Is Considered Cardio Exercise?
By Danielle Clark
Swimming is considered a cardio exercise, but you've got to do more than just float in a pool for optimal health benefits.
It would be wonderful if sitting on the couch eating a bag of chips were considered cardio exercise, but this is not the case. Cardio exercise has many outlets in the fitness industry, but simply getting your heart rate raised through repeated movements of arms, legs and even your booty will do the trick. Cardio exercise benefits many aspects of your everyday, including your mood, your health and even your concentration.

Cardio
There’s no magic formula when it comes to cardio. Cardio exercise is also known as cardiovascular exercise or aerobic exercise. During cardio activity, you move the large muscles of your legs, hips, butt and arms, which in turn makes your heart beat faster. You’ll also find that you breathe faster and more deeply. This increases the blood flow to your limbs and muscles and then back to your lungs. Many activities qualify as cardio exercise, such as swimming, bicycling, walking, jogging, tennis, basketball and even jumping rope.

Maximum Heart Rate
Another way of measuring exercise is by your maximum heart rate. To receive all the benefits of cardio exercise you’ll need to work hard enough to increase your heart rate to its target zone. First find out what your maximum heart rate is to determine your target zone. To do so, subtract your age from 220. For example, a 30-year-old will have a maximum heart rate of 190 beats per minute. Beginners to cardio exercise should target a moderate heart rate of 50 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate. For a 30-year-old that would be 95 to 133 beats per minute. As you become used to cardio exercise, increase the intensity and target heart rate to 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate.

Intensity
To get the most benefit out of your cardio workout the intensity of the exercise should be fall somewhere between moderate or vigorous, according to MayoClinic.com. It’s important to find a balance when working out. Gauging how you feel during your workout is a safe way to exercise and increase the intensity as you become stronger. For beginners, start with a light exercise intensity. You’ll notice you can easily keep up a conversation during your workout and you’ll also not see a difference in your breathing pattern. Moderate exercise intensity feels different. You’ll perspire a little after 10 minutes of moderate intensity exercise and your breath will also quicken. With vigorous intensity you’ll definitely feel challenged. You won’t be able to talk more than a few words without stopping for a moment to breathe and you’ll start sweating after just a few minutes of vigorous exercise.

Frequency
For moderate cardio exercise, aim for at least 150 minutes per week, according to the American Heart Association. For those who are interested in vigorous exercise, the American Heart Association suggests at least 75 minutes per week at this intensity. You can spread cardio workouts throughout the week, five days a week for 30 minutes, or you can divide your time up into two or three segments per day, with 10 to 15 minutes of exercise per segment.

Daily Calories for Weight Lifting
By Erin Coleman, R.D., L.D.
Aim for at least three sets of eight to 20 repetitions.
Food is the fuel that your body requires for successful weight-training, and the number of calories you consume each day can make or break each strength session. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans suggests pumping iron at least two times each week. Your fitness and weight goals determine your daily calorie needs for lifting weight.

Strength-Training Basics
Lifting weights on a regular basis can trim and tone your problem areas, such as muffin tops or love handles. Strength-training increases muscle definition, burns body fat and reduces your chronic disease risks, according to a review published in 2009 edition of “Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise.” For best results, work each muscle group – including your legs, glutes, back, chest, shoulders, biceps, triceps and abdomen -- at least one time weekly.

Weight Maintenance
If weight maintenance is the goal of lifting weights, your caloric needs are 16 to 18 calories per pound of your body weight, according to Harvard Health Publications. If you’re moderately active, shoot for 16 calories per pound; if you lift weights regularly, aim for 18 calories per pound of your body weight. For example, an avid weightlifter who weighs 125 pounds and pumps iron regularly needs about 2,250 calories daily to maintain her physique.

Weight Loss
Combining weight lifting with cardiovascular exercises, such as walking, jogging, biking or using an elliptical machine, can help you meet your weight-loss goal. The 2009 review in “Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise” notes getting more than four hours of exercise, including strength training, each week is associated with weight loss. Boost your caloric expenditure by 500 to 1,000 calories a day by working out, reduce your calories by the same amount or combine these two methods to create a 500- to 1,000-calorie-per-day caloric deficit. This strategy will help you lose 1 to 2 pounds per week, notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Build Muscle Mass
Building muscle mass warrants an increase in calories. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency recommends boosting your intake by 500 to 1,000 calories daily to pack on pounds in the form of muscle. Weight lifting regularly is also a must. Train most days of the week, but avoid working the same muscle group two days in a row to allow time for proper muscle recovery. As you become stronger, slightly increase the amount of weight you’re lifting for maximum muscle gains.

Bloating & Gas When Exercising
By Bari Auerbach
Modifying eating habits can help reduce bloating and gas when exercising.
Experiencing bloating and gas when exercising can be uncomfortable and flat out embarrassing. To promote peak exercise performance, dietitian Natalie Egan of Brigham and Women’s Hospital recommends heightening awareness about common causes of bloating and gas, such as eating habits, and fluid and sodium intake. After identifying potential culprits, you can implement dietary and lifestyle changes to help minimize or eliminate bloating and gas discomfort. Consider consulting a health-care provider if you routinely experience bloating and gas or symptoms progressively worsen.

Foods To Avoid
If bloating and gas are making your abdomen feel larger than normal and impeding your workout routine, it can be helpful to avoid eating dairy products containing lactose and beans that can cause bacterial fermentation inside the colon and, thus, flatulence. Bloating and gas are also associated with a rapid, significant increase of dietary fiber; fatty or fried foods; bulky foods such as broccoli and cabbage; dried fruits; products containing artificial sweeteners, such as many low-carb or sugar-free foods; and carbonated beverages.

Fluids, Sodium And Air
Bloating and gas when exercising can be caused by drinking too much fluid or not taking in enough sodium, according to sports medicine specialist Dr. Chris Koutures. To tell if you’re drinking too much fluid or not getting enough salt, weigh yourself before and after exercising. Any postworkout weight gain, or swelling of fingers, hands, feet or ankles, could indicate the need to limit overall fluid intake or increase salt intake around exercise times. Swallowing air while breathing heavily during aerobic exercise, chewing gum, gulping drinks, using a straw, talking while eating, not chewing food thoroughly, and drinking from water fountains can also lead to increased bloating and gas.

Preventing Bloating And Gas
Eating foods high in protein, fiber or fat shortly before exercising may contribute to feeling bloated and gassy. Sports dietitian and triathlon coach Bob Seebohar advises waiting to exercise at least two or three hours after consuming a small, healthy meal or snack so your body will have adequate time to properly digest proteins and carbohydrates. To help prevent bloating due to water retention, fitness competitor and trainer Shannon Clark suggests exercising regularly; eating potassium-rich foods such as bananas, spinach, tomatoes, nuts and fish; minimizing consumption of carbohydrate-dense foods such as pasta, bread and rice; increasing calcium intake; and adding parsley, a natural diuretic, to foods.

Tips And Considerations
Natural therapies such as drinking peppermint or chamomile teas may help alleviate gas and bloating when exercising or engaging in other daily lifestyle activities. Over-the-counter gas treatments are also available, including some containing enzymes that help break down hard-to-digest, gas-producing carbohydrates. Before trying any remedies, consider consulting your health-care provider to discuss potential causes of bloating and gas, and possible underlying conditions.

DIETS FOR WEIGHT LOSS
Can You Lose Weight If You Eat Under 2,000 Calories a Day?
By Erin Coleman, R.D., L.D.
Choose fiber-rich fruits and veggies over sweets.
Most women will peel away pounds eating fewer than 2,000 calories a day. In fact, with the exception of very active women, eating 2,000 calories or more in a day likely won’t cut it for effective weight loss. Your individualized weight-loss calorie needs are based on your body weight, current calorie intake and activity level.

Weight-Loss Calorie Needs
To shed pounds safely and effectively, most women require fewer than 2,000 calories a day. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute suggests most inactive women require 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day to drop weight, while active women and those weighing more than 164 pounds should aim for 1,200- to 1,600-calorie weight-loss diets. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests cutting your current intake by 500 to 1,000 calories daily to drop 1 to 2 pounds weekly.

Exceptions
You may need 2,000 calories, or more, daily to lose 1 to 2 pounds per week if you regularly perform hard-core exercises at vigorous intensities or for long durations. For example, if you keep your regular calorie intake constant but burn an extra 500 to 1,000 calories daily by increasing your physical activity, you should still shed 1 to 2 pounds per week. Harvard Health Publications estimates a 155-pound woman who runs for one hour a day at a pace of 6 miles per hour will burn about 745 calories daily, which leads to a 1.5-pound weekly weight loss.

Importance Of Protein
Boosting your protein intake will make it easier for you to cut calories and melt away fat. Protein also helps maintain lean muscle when you shed pounds. A 2008 review published in the “American Journal of Clinical Nutrition” found protein increases satiety more than fat or carbs. A study published in a 2012 edition of “Physiology and Behavior” reports high-protein diets can help reduce body weight and body fat. Healthy, protein-rich foods include seafood, skinless poultry, egg whites, soy products, low-fat dairy foods, legumes, seitan, nuts and seeds.

Concerns
Although eating fewer than 2,000 calories a day helps most women shed pounds, eating too few calories is a no-no. Very low-calorie diets containing 500 to 800 calories daily lead to rapid weight loss, but also cause unpleasant side effects. These may include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue and gallstone formation, according to Weight-control Information Network. Since rapid weight loss helps reduce obesity-related health conditions, chat with your doctor to see if you’re a candidate for a medically supervised VLCD program. However, a 2006 review published in the journal “Obesity” found that low-calorie diets containing 1,000 to 1,500 calories daily work just as well as very low-calorie diets long term.
